# pivot-progress-bar
my third project for the pre-work section of the pivot program! I took inspiration from one of my peers, Anthony Tennyson (<a href="https://symphonious-biscochitos-4b5c13.netlify.app/">project here</a>), but added my own spin to it!

as I begin learning javascript, I'm sure I could make this even better! as it is, I am happy with how it came out!
<a href="https://jhbforlife-pivot-progress-bar.netlify.app">you can see it deployed here!</a>

issues for future:
- use javascript to replace the h2 text content directly
- animate the loading text either with "." -> "..." or a spinning loading indicator
